##Role and project
<a href="https://sider.review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sider</a> is a static code analysis SaaS for GitHub pull requests with the mission to simplify developers’ lives by automating code review. I have been a full-time **designer and front-end developer** working along with a team of 5 developers and other departments since December of 2017. My role included design, code, and maintenance of their main website, with at least 4 rounds of iteration based on customer feedback and analytics.

##Rebranding
In spring 2018, the decision was made to rename and rebrand the company, my role was to lead the rebranding process. This included participating in company and product renaming (SideCI to Sider), market research, new identity and logo creation.

##Redesign
I was in charge of several rounds of Sider’s website redesign, as the product was constantly changing and evolving, the tone and contents on the site itself had to reflect those changes. Based on user feedback collected by the members of our team, we could craft better content and, as a result, better design to support that content.

##Development
The coding was done in **slim, vanilla JavaScript and SASS**. Using custom queries, mixins, and grid for the responsive layout to ensure simplicity and light-weight by avoiding any and all frameworks. SVG images were used where possible to ensure fast loading speed.

##Optimization
By creating a better mobile experience and clearer copy and structure, over the time I worked in Sider, it was possible to triple session duration among new users from 30sec to 1min 30sec on mobile and decrease new mobile user bounce rate from over 70% to 52%.

I also carried out a round of technical optimizations for mobile web users to decrease the weight of the page, which resulted in an overall bounce rate among mobile users to decrease from 82% to below 70%.

To achieve better loading speed, a combination of approaches were used including utilizing an image-optimization package, combining javascript source files and using media queries in images to let the browser decide the best-fitting size. This resulted in a better performance boost and an increase of <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsider.review%2F&tab=desktop" target="_balnk" rel="noopener">PageSpeed Insights</a> mobile and desktop score increases of over 20%.
